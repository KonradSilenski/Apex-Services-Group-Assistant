# Apex Services Group Assistant

This full stack solution was created as an in-house tool to manage incoming engineer notes for work to be quoted by Apex SG.
The assistant was designed to be integrated with Propeller's servers to pull and write data to and utilises a machine learning
model in order to determine the appropriate SOR codes for each visit done by an engineer.
